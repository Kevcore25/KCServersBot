LOAN_DESC = f'''You can loan up to a certain amount of Credits in order to help you become richer!
By default, you may only loan up to a value of 50% of your Score. 
Having at least 75 Unity will bump it to 75% of your Score.
As score generally starts linear and slows during late-game, this usually is a good number of how much you can loan up to.
Score depends on many factors, so negative Unity for example would cause lower scores as well.

After loaning an amount of Credits, you must pay an interest within 1 week, or you will suffer Unity losses.
The interest is randomized from 10% to 20%, and the Unity loss depends on how much you had loaned:
* For less than 1k loaned: -50 Unity
* For 1k loaned and over: -100 Unity

You must pay off your loan debt before being able to loan again.
If you fail to pay your loan before a reset, you will lose -25 Unity following the reset, negatively impacting your early-game start and thus your score.

During your loan period, you can spend your Credits on whatever you like, whether it is gambling, investing, or buying items from the shop.
However, you are unable to use the KCash exchange service while you are on a loan though the Gem exchange still works.
