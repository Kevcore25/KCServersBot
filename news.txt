# Version 3.1 - Minor changes
## Changes:
- News command, showing a log of recent changes
- The minimum wealth power has been increased from -50% to 0%
    - This means it would be harder to gain Credits while being poor
    - Also, this changes the rate the bot gains Credits 
- The formula for Rob Defense Level for the rob command has changed
    - Essentially, it is now harder to rob larger balance differences
        - Instead of an additive value for differences, it is now multiplicative
    - Also, the base Rob Defense Level of the bot is changed to a much lower value (350 > 50)
        - Also also, successfully robbing the bot will give you a Bot Stock % of 5%
        - and **failing to rob the bot will reset your Bot Stock %**
- Hourly's Credit Earning Perk duration is changed from 10 minutes to 15 minutes
- Daily failure cost has its formula changed
    - 1% is equalivent to 0.5 Credit lost. E.g. 300% wealth power = 150 Credits lost
- Joining a KCMC server (as long as your Server Listings is on) will grant 0.1 Unity per minute
    - You can gain a maximum of 10 Unity; this resets every time the bot restarts (everyday)
    - The server does not need to support *KMCExtract* (e.g. KCHG (or Gun PvP))
- Work command, allowing you to gain Unity and Credits every hour
- Daily command no longer scales off Wealth Power and Unity gain is changed from 5 -> 3
## Patches:
None
